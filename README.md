# java-android-game

The game is in Java and used Android Studio.  If Trump's head crosses the screen 5 times, Trump is re-elected, and "Hail to the Chief" plays. If the player pushes the "UP" and "DOWN" buttons to move Mueller's head and blocks Trump's head from crossing the screen 5 times, then Trump is impeached and "Awwww!" plays.  The "PLAY AGAIN" button restarts the game.

The project zip file is ksuzu2_game.zip

A video demo of the utility is Kenta_Suzue_Project5.mp4
